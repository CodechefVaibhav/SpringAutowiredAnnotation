You can use @Autowired annotation on setter methods to get rid of the <property> element in XML 
configuration file. When Spring finds an @Autowired annotation used with setter methods, it tries
 to perform byType autowiring on the method.
 
 if @Autowired is used with a varible of a class then you don't need to create its setter method	
 
 & @Autowired is used with a setter then you don't need to create <property> tag of that variable
 under <bean> tag in xml
